			<h3>11? .. years of Heavy Equipment service..and counting.</h3>
			<p>I have fixed everything, everywhere, for everybody. At least it sounds good to say so.
		 Truly though I never could have imagined that the humble beginings of my career would take me so far. </p>

			<h3>Maintenance Never Sleeps - The Warrior Ethos</h3>
			<p>Proudly served (2012-2016) In the California Army National Guard as a 91H Tracked Vehicle Mechanic.</p>

			<p>Completed "track school" at Ft Lee Virgina Ordnance Island. Where we trained to support "the mission" at all costs 
		 no matter the sittuation with no excuse. Even if a certain piece of equipment needed repair that was not our specialty we
		 were expected to get the job done. For expample as a 91H I focused on tracked vehicles, tanks, personnel carriers, and mobile 
		 howitzer field artillery equipment ... but if a generator or Humvee needed repair and we were the only mechanics available 
		 we would figure out the problem and get it done. </p>
			<p>"Maintenance Never Sleeps", was a phrase introduced to me by one of my favorite military leaders. SFC Ybarra, while supporting 
		 the 1/144th Field Artillery Regiment. Life in a Armored Cavalry convoy could be rough, fast paced, and high pressure with little sleep. 
		 We were on call 24/7 to go save a tank in the middle of the night if we were in the field and would work all night to make sure back up 
		 equipment was ready if we were working out of the shop on main post. Litterly ..No Sleep. Anything could break down at any moment and we 
		 needed to be ready. To sum up the phrase Maintenance Never Sleeps and tell you what it means to me ... I would have to say it means : Attention to detail 
		 and dedication to the highest degree.</p>

					<img src="docs/assets/images/bigassbus.JPG" width="50%" height="40%">
				</div>
			<p>Trying to build a career and a stable civilian life. Class 8 trucks (class 7, and 6 medium duty as well) have been good to me. Through out multiple government shut downs, 
			national disaters, economic downturns... if trucks are running. We are making money. Other than the military I'd have to say my experience with South Bay Truck Center in Long Beach
			California and the greater Velocity Vehicle Group family of truck and bus dealership has built my career. Quickly learning modern aftertreament emission systems and DOT commercial truck 
			requirements and safety standards has been valuable. Building engines, becomming a master of electrical wiring harness repair and computer diagnostics has payed the bills and satisfied my appeitite for 
			solving problems.  </p>
			<p> Frieghtliners, Peterbilts, Kenworths, Internationals, Macks, Volvos, Hinos, Isuzu, Ford (250-750)... all of them dude. Safe-T-Liners, bluebirds, autocar, ICBus, kalmar yard goats. I have worked on all of them. And not just small repairs or basic services but significant indepth repairs on all them. Allisons and Eatons, automatics, automated, manuals, clutches,
			xy shifters, clutch actuators, speed sensors, TCM harness repair, on all of them multiple times. Third members, carrier bearings, wheel hubs all of them. Detroit warranty, Cummins warranty, Paccar warranty. Fuel injectors, fuel pumps, lift pumps, high pressure, unit injectors, all of them. Head gaskets, in frames, cam housing seals, injector cups, upper timming cover reseal, flywheel housings
			all of them. SCR diagnostics and repair, DEF pumps, DEF dosers, DPF filter cleans / repalace, nox sensors, differential pressure sensor repair, replace, clean all of them. EGR coolers, egr valves, turbos, VGT's all of them dude. All of them. Disc brakes, drum brakes, tail shaft brakes, foot brake vales, air bags, leveling valves, 5th wheels, ABS systems, meritor, wabco, bendix all of them.

		<div>
			<p>Heavy Equipment reminds me often times of the behemoth military equipment that started my career. They tend to be more unique and specialized for what ever their entended functions are. Unique challenges always  arise when maintaining 
			large machines. Cost to transport usually means repairs need to completed on site and an advanced level of improvising and thinking on your feet while maintaining safety always comes into play. This can be fun, I like a challenge as such a mechanic working 
			monster machines brings some natural inescapable level of pride. After years of working on a decent mix of machine and truck it is now hard to differentiate the two. Trucks are now in my mind just another peice of equipment, the simplest and most straight forward peice of 
			equipment in the broad range of machines that I have worked on. </p>

		<h3>Quadcopters!</h3>
			<p>Took the plunge into this hobby December 2022. And boy did I dive deep. Never wasting a dime on off the shelf quadcopters or beginner products, I went straight into homebuilt freestyle racing quads like a moth to the flame. Carbon fiber frames,
			raw electronic components, and a suite of specialized software and tools. This hobby has quite the cost of entry and technical expertise required to gate keep itself. Instantly hooked.</p>
	
		<div class="doesitwork">
			<div>
				<p>!ELRS! All hail ELRS!!! Open source radio communication protocol for everyone!!! Express Long Range System seems to have taken over the market within the community of "hobby grade" quadcopter pilots. And I myself am a huge fan....I can not compare it to anything else because 
				it is the only system I have used. And though Iam told the long range performance is amazing I also have not tested those limits myself. All I can say is that in my experience it works great. A lot of beginners in this hobby will and have complained about technical difficulties while strugglign to get their system 
				setup. It doesnt bother me. It works. Its reliable. Its available. And its cheap. Truth be told this elrs reciever with a built in "tower antenna", pictured here, much like the similar "flat ceramic antenna" version are well known as obsolete. However they can be had for about $20 and are still reliable to aprox. 500m range. Which has been good
				enough for me.

				<p>STM32F405 flight controllers get the job done reliably.
				EMAX motors reliability and performance for an unbeatable price.
				Analog Foxeer cameras again price performance and reliability. All of my builds have been budget builds. I got started 
				just when digital fpv was taking over and decided to keep it old school.

				<p>Ive stuck with betaflight for flight controller software. Pictured here is not actually a betaflight screen but an ELRS setup 
				window. Betaflight has been straight forward to work with and though I am interested in experimenting with inav and other options 
				there is still a lot of settings and tuning to learn and play around with in betalfight.  </p>

	<p>Soon after getting started as a complete amateur pilot work began designing 3D printed components and accesories for my quads. Everything that has been accomplished so far with my quadcopter related design work has been fulfiling. Taking an idea from concept to a physical part brings a thrilling sense of accomplishent. Nearly every design Ive created is available for download on my Cults 3D page. All downloads 
	and purchases of my designs are motivation to continue doing what I love most as often I can. Thank YOU! To everyone of my supporters your interest in my design work means a lot to me. </p>

			<p>These side plates for the Source One V3 frame were recently designed to customize the aesthetic of the quadcopter and add some protection for the internal electronics. After building my first quads the concept of creating my own custom body panels was something I had to do. My go to parametric modeling software is FreeCAD, and my design process for making small parts is typically the same.
			Taking measurements, jotting down notes, and hand sketching the rough concept until I have enough dimensions to start modeling. The Source One V3 frame was fortuneatley a friendly frame to work with. Due to the frame being symetrical multiple features could be mirrored across the Y or X axis of the part. After creating an initial "blank" design it would be easy to draft different text or 
			logos to make many variations. Success with this vision was highly motivating to begin creating side plates for the Ummagawd Grinderino frame, viewable on my cults page.   </p>
			<p>The winglets were designed to not affect normal flight controll. Wings on a quadcopter are basically useless and would most likely result in reduced efficiency overall. </p>

	<div class="doesitwork">

			<p>Perpetual incitement to design, create, and modify. Focusing on more accessories for the Grinderino began with some basic landing skis. There is now a entire kit of designs for this frame. Here is the first. These skis are terrible and accidently awesome. Terrible because its almost impossible to install the mounting screws due to the "tubes" of the skis being directly above the mounting hole positions. 
			massive oversight there. However the width ... is perfect for protecting the props. If the quad lands, tilts or falls on either left or right side, the blades will not strike the ground. Boom brilliant, I take all credit. The landing gear kit published now includes 2 completely different concepts. The second concept is a bad ass 3 legged design with aggresive angles.</p>

			<p>More ambitous projects are in the works for my quadcopters. Here is The DROPPER QUAD. Currently being developed on a 5in open source frame using a 
			RP2040 microcontroller running Micropython. This entire concept will soon be migrated to a 7in frame for further development. Only the mounting bracket 
			for the "aux mother boad" is my design, the servo grabber claw was found on cults by 'MECHENGINEERMIKE'. It definitely saved some time using a servo claw that 
			was already available and 3d printable. Having 20x20 mounting holes made it perfect for my application.   </p>

		<h3>Servo Man</h3>
		<p>Meet Servo Man! This guy was put together over some holiday weekend not long ago to practice my physical programing and 
		grow my micropython coding skills. Some cut out card board hot glued to a pair of 9g 180* servos , which are also directly 
		hot glued to the bread board, standing on 3d printed legs , and illuminated with some leds. This stationary, 2-DOF(?), "robot" 
		will be a stepping stone to a more complex biped however I do have plans continue developing Servo Man. I want to add multiple sensors
		to create UI/UX interactive functions. </p>
		<p>Running micropython on a rasberry pi pico microcontroller, Servo Man is more of an animatronic in its current state running a loop
		of preprogramed movement, blink, and beep sequences. The red led eyes blink to animate a wink. The beeps are timmed with the 
		blink of the center mouth green led to animate talking.  </p>
		<p>This project is also the first that has been documented so that anyone who is interested can follow along and build their own Servo Character 
		creation. Videos and information for how to build your own Servo Man can be found on my YouTube and KoFi page.</p>

			<p>Practicing using the loft tool in FreeCAD and thought "Mirror delete Horns" for my Honda CBR300R would be a good idea. Played around with the
